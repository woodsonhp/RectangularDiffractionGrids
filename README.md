# RectangularDiffraction

**A MATLAB visualization of Fraunhofer diffraction of light by a rectangular aperture.**

***Features:*** Calculates the intensity distribution, colors the figure by wavelength, and handles multicolor situations. Light source, aperture size, light screen and image output parameters are all adjustable.

The code applies to a Fraunhofer diffraction with following ***assumptions***:

*   Only one aperture in rectangular size, thus considering **diffraction only**.

*   The distance between the light source and the aperture is much larger than the aperture size, so that the light on the aperture plane is considered as **parallel light incident perpendicularly and uniformly**.

*   The distance between the light screen and the aperture is much larger than the aperture size, so that the **Fraunhofer diffraction model** is applicable.

*   Each calculation only considers ideal monochromatic light with a **fixed wavelength** in current version.

Thus the ***core equation*** to calculate intensity distribution is:

## Installation

1.  Download project folder

2.  Download the `spectrumRGB.m`, `RGB2HSI.m` and `HSI2RGB.m` functions to the same folder *(See the [Requirements](#Requirements) section for more information)*

3.  Run the [`test1.m`](test1.m) for the first illustration!


## Requirements

Tested on MATLAB R2018b. Image Processing Toolbox Required.

So far, this project (the `colorDiff.m` function, specifically) needs the following functions to perform the coloring feature properly:

*   `spectrumRGB.m` and its correlating functions: convert the spectral color with wavelength to RGB format, by Jeff Mather, The MathWorks, Inc., you can find it on [*MATLAB File Exchange*](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/7021-spectral-and-xyz-color-functions)

*   `RGB2HSI.m` and `HSI2RGB.m`: conversions between RGB and HSI format images, by R. C. Gonzalez, R. E. Woods, & S. L. Eddins,  Digital Image Processing Using MATLAB, you can find it on *a course page ([RGB2HSI.m](http://fourier.eng.hmc.edu/e161/dipum/rgb2hsi.m) and [HSI2RGB.m](http://fourier.eng.hmc.edu/e161/dipum/hsi2rgb.m))*


## Examples

#### Intensity image, infrared light, narrow aperture
```
λ =  1000 nm
a =  1.00 μm
b = 20.00 μm
```

#### Multiple colors of mercury lamp spectrum
```
λ = [365.05, 404.58, 435.87, 546.05, 579.11] nm
I = [  0.30,   0.40,   1.00,   0.80,   0.20] * 2.5e7
a = 2.00 μm
b = 1.00 μm
```

#### White light
```
λ = 350~750 nm
a =    1.00 μm
b =   12.00 μm
```

## Todos

*   Support different `lim` and `dim` input value for X and Y axis

*   Support the actual situation of non-ideal monochromatic light, that the wavelength is not a fix value but a range around center peak wavelength, in `intensityDiff()`

*   Support image controlling and displaying of brightness, contrast, etc.

*   Support color mapping for non-visible light

*   Support auto deciding value of `Iabs` for source, and `lim` for screen

*   Support other aperture shape of Fraunhofer diffraction, Fresnel diffraction and interference of light
